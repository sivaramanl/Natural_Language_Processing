Mr/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Dursley/NNP ,/, of/IN number/NN four/CD ,/, Privet/NNP Drive/NNP ,/, were/VBD proud/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN they/PRP were/VBD perfectly/RB normal/JJ ,/, thank/VB you/PRP very/RB much/JJ ./.
They/PRP were/VBD the/DT last/JJ people/NNS you/PRP 'd/MD expect/VB to/TO be/VB involved/VBN in/IN anything/NN strange/JJ or/CC mysterious/JJ ,/, because/IN they/PRP just/RB did/VBD n't/RB hold/VB with/IN such/JJ nonsense/NN ./.
Mr/NNP Dursley/NNP was/VBD the/DT director/NN of/IN a/DT firm/NN called/VBN Grunnings/NNP ,/, which/WDT made/VBD drills/NNS ./.
He/PRP was/VBD a/DT big/JJ ,/, beefy/JJ man/NN with/IN hardly/RB any/DT neck/NN ,/, although/IN he/PRP did/VBD have/VB a/DT very/RB large/JJ moustache/NN ./.
Mrs/NNP Dursley/NNP was/VBD thin/JJ and/CC blonde/JJ and/CC had/VBD nearly/RB twice/RB the/DT usual/JJ amount/NN of/IN neck/NN ,/, which/WDT came/VBD in/IN very/RB useful/JJ as/IN she/PRP spent/VBD so/RB much/RB of/IN her/PRP$ time/NN craning/VBG over/IN garden/NN fences/NNS ,/, spying/NNP on/IN the/DT neighbours/NNS ./.
The/DT Dursleys/NNPS had/VBD a/DT small/JJ son/NN called/VBN Dudley/NNP and/CC in/IN their/PRP$ opinion/NN there/EX was/VBD no/DT finer/NN boy/NN anywhere/RB ./.
The/DT Dursleys/NNPS had/VBD everything/NN they/PRP wanted/VBD ,/, but/CC they/PRP also/RB had/VBD a/DT secret/NN ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ greatest/JJS fear/NN was/VBD that/IN somebody/NN would/MD discover/VB it/PRP ./.
They/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB they/PRP could/MD bear/VB it/PRP if/IN anyone/NN found/VBD out/RP about/IN the/DT Potters/NNPS ./.
Mrs/NNP Potter/NNP was/VBD Mrs/NNP Dursley/NNP 's/POS sister/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP had/VBD n't/RB met/VBN for/IN several/JJ years/NNS ;/: in/IN fact/NN ,/, Mrs/NNP Dursley/NNP pretended/VBD she/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB a/DT sister/NN ,/, because/IN her/PRP$ sister/NN and/CC her/PRP$ good-for-nothing/JJ husband/NN were/VBD as/RB unDursleyish/JJ as/IN it/PRP was/VBD possible/JJ to/TO be/VB ./.
The/DT Dursleys/NNPS shuddered/VBD to/TO think/VB what/WP the/DT neighbours/NNS would/MD say/VB if/IN the/DT Potters/NNPS arrived/VBD in/IN the/DT street/NN ./.
The/DT Dursleys/NNPS knew/VBD that/IN the/DT Potters/NNPS had/VBD a/DT small/JJ son/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, but/CC they/PRP had/VBD never/RB even/RB seen/VBN him/PRP ./.
This/DT boy/NN was/VBD another/DT good/JJ reason/NN for/IN keeping/VBG the/DT Potters/NNPS away/RB ;/: they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB want/VB Dudley/NNP mixing/VBG with/IN a/DT child/NN like/IN that/DT ./.
When/WRB Mr/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP Dursley/NNP woke/VBD up/RB on/IN the/DT dull/JJ ,/, grey/JJ Tuesday/NNP our/PRP$ story/NN starts/NNS ,/, there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN about/IN the/DT cloudy/JJ sky/NN outside/RB to/TO suggest/VB that/IN strange/JJ and/CC mysterious/JJ things/NNS would/MD soon/RB be/VB happening/VBG all/DT over/IN the/DT country/NN ./.
Mr/NNP Dursley/NNP hummed/VBD as/IN he/PRP picked/VBD out/RP his/PRP$ most/RBS boring/JJ tie/NN for/IN work/NN and/CC Mrs/NNP Dursley/NNP gossiped/VBN away/RP happily/RB as/IN she/PRP wrestled/VBD a/DT screaming/NNP Dudley/NNP into/IN his/PRP$ high/JJ chair/NN ./.
None/NN of/IN them/PRP noticed/VBD a/DT large/JJ tawny/JJ owl/NN flutter/NN past/IN the/DT window/NN ./.
